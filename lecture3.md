### Perspectives on Data Science

Dhar makes three major points in the article:

[Data Science and Prediction](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169933-data-science-and-prediction/fulltext)

- Data Science is the study of generalizable extraction of knowledge from data.
- A common requirement in assessing whether new knowledge is actionable for decision making is its predictive power, not just its ability to explain the past.
- A data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning math, machine learning, statistics, computer science, along with a deep understanding of the craft of problem formulation to engineer effective solutions.

[Berman - Realizing the Potential of data science](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/4/226372-realizing-the-potential-of-data-science/fulltext)

- Data science can help connect previously disparate disciplines, communities, and users to provide richer and deeper insights into current and future challenges.

- Data science encompasses a broad set of areas, including
  - Data-focused algorithmic innovation and machine learning
  - Data mining and use of data for discovery
  - Collection, organization, stewardship and preservation of data;
  - Privacy challenges and policy associated with data; and
  - Pedagogy to support the education and training of data-savvy professionals

- There is a growing gap between commercial and academic research practice for data systems that needs to be addressed.

"Data never exists in a vacuum. Like a biological organism, data has a life cycle, from birth through an active life to immortality or some form of expiration. Also like a living and intelligent organism, it survives in an environment that provides physical support, social context, and existential meaning."

Acquire -> Clean -> Use/Reuse -> Publish -> Preserve/Destroy

### The data life cycle vs. scientific communities

- The data life cycle diagram suggests a seamless set of actions and transformations on data, but in many scientifiy communities and disciplines today these steps are isolates.
  - *Domain scientists* may focus on generating and using data
  - *Computer scientists* often focus on platform and performance issues, including mining, organizing, modeling, visualizing, as well as the mechanisms for eliciting meaning from the data through machine learning and other approaches.
  - The physical processes of acquisition and instrument control are often the focus of *engineering*.
  - *Statisticians* may focus on the mathematics of models for risk and inference
  - *Information scientists* and *library scientists* ...

### Computing Research and Data Science
1. Data management
  - Data science requiers a much deeper understanding and representation of how data is accessed
1. Computational
  - Large data volume, very high data rates, and very large number of users, demand new systems and new algorithms
  - New systems architectures that can accomodate heterogeneity and irregular structure in data access and communication are needed
1. Statistical assumptions and machine learning techniques
1. Human computer interaction
1. Supporting the entire data science lifecycle

#### So What Is a Data Scientists, Really?
- In Industry:
  - A data scientists is someone who knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human.
  - She spends a lot of time in process of collecting and cleaning data. This process requires persistence, statistics, and software engineering skills.
  - Once she gets the data into shape, a crucial part is exploratory data analysis, which combines visualization and data sense.
  - She will find patterns, build models, and algorithms - some with the intention of understanding product usage and others to serve as prototypes that ultimately get baked back into the product.
  - She may design experiments, and she is a critical part of data driven decision making.
  - She will communicate with team members, engineers and leadership in clear language and with data visualizations so that even if her colleagues are not immersed in the data themselvesd, they will understand the implications

- In Academia
  - An academic data scientist is a scientist, trained in anything from social science to biology, who works with large amounts of data, and must grapple with computational problems posed by the structure, size, messiness, and the complexity and nature of the data, while simultaneously solving a real world problem.

History of data scientists in academia:
- Experimental
- Theoretical
- Computational (simulation)
- The 4th Paradigm (Data) - connectedness
