### Lecture 2 - Data Science

#### What is Data Science?

*When was computer science born?*

R tutorials next week
- Tuesday Aug 31, 3:00 - 4:30 pm
- Thursday Sep 2, 3:00 - 4:30 pm
- Both tutorials will happen virtually, over Zoom (see Canvas for links)

#### Outline:
- Big Data and Data Science hype
  - and getting past the hype
- Why now?
- Landscape of perspectives
- Skill set needed

#### Big Data and Data Science Hype

What might be eyebrow-raising about __Big Data__ and __Data Science__?
- Lack of definition around basic terminology
- Lack of recognition for researchers in academia and industry who have been working on this kind of stuff for years
- The hype can be crazy

*Around all the hype, there is a ring of truth*

Data science is something new - *it has access to a larger body of knowledge and methodology as well as a process that has foundations in both statistics and computer science.*

We are here in this course to understand this better and contribute to the pursuit of a sharper definition.

Computer science as an *academic discipline* began in the 60's (emphasis on programming language theory/design, compilers, operating systems, mathematical theory).

Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context free languages, and computability.

In the 70's, algorithms were added as an important component of theory.

Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on applications, and there are many reasons for this change.

The merging of computing and communications has played an important role, and the enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in natural sciences, in commerce, and
in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting.

*The emergence of the web and social networks, which are by far the largest such structures, presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.*

#### Why Now? Enablers of today's "big data revolution"

- Commerical
- Profileration of sensors
- Creation of almost all information in digital form
  - Datafication
- Dramatic cost reduction in storage
  - You can afford to keep all the data
- Dramatic cost in network bandwidth
  - You can move the data to where it is needed
- Dramatic algorithmic breakthroughs
  - Machine Learning, Data Mining, Fundamental advances in CS and Statistics
- Even more powerful models producing ever increasing volumes of data that must be analyzed

#### Landscape of perspectives

*Danger zone* - don't know if the assumptions of the data are met, math and stat knowledge lacking, ethical issues :P
